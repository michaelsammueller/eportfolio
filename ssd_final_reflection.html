							<h1>Secure Software Design: Final Reflection</h1>
							<p>Word Count: 1,088</p>
							<p>For my final reflection on the Secure Software Design module, I have decided to take an approach which is overall more structured than the reflections I have written throughout the module. While I used the e-Portfolio to record my participation and work throughout each unit, I also used it to reflect on my emotions and thoughts throughout the course. Each unit reflection allowed me to reflect on the module I had just completed, as well as to look back at the modules which came before. As I am now in unit 12, I can reflect on the entire course and draw my final conclusion.</p>
							<h2>Introduction & Reflection on the Module</h2>
							<p>The “Secure Software Development” module was one of the more challenging modules of this course thus far. Being equally interesting and informative as it was challenging, this module has also been one of my favourites.</p>
							<p>Cybersecurity is one of my passions, which I have been looking into for a while now. Using services like “tryhackme.com”, I dabbled with various vulnerabilities, giving me an overview of what makes concepts like authentication, authorisation, and input sanitisation so important.
							Based on this interest, I was very excited to start with the module. Specifically, the idea of having to plan and build secure software of some kind really intrigued me. I decided to look into detecting security vulnerabilities early on and found it particularly interesting to read about vulnerabilities in web applications and how to detect them using Python with tools such as bandit or PyT (Micheelsen et.al., 2016).</p>
							<p>Something that has been done in every module thus far is to give a slow but efficient introduction to the subject, building on what was taught in the previous modules. This allows us as students to gain an initial understanding of new concepts before being asked to apply them in a practical environment.</p>
							<h2>Reflection on Teamwork</h2>
							<p>The teamwork aspect of this module is what I was most unsure about. Being my first time experiencing teamwork on this course, I did not know what to expect, especially given the fact that this is an online, part-time course, and everyone has their own schedules outside of the university. As a student, you have little control over whom you will be in a group with. Your team members have a huge impact on the overall outcome of the project. I was very fortunate with my team members, as we all worked together very efficiently and without any disagreements. Of course, there were, at times, contradicting opinions, but by following a democratic “majority wins” approach, we could get past these situations quite easily.</p>
							<p>The design phases, in preparation for the first submission, allowed each one of us to gather references, information, and tools we would be able to use for the coding assignment. Each of us had different levels of experience in different areas, allowing us to focus on specific application parts. We divided responsibilities based on “services” within our application rather than assigning specific areas such as “security” or “testing” to individual members. In doing so, we could gather knowledge about external libraries very quickly. We each created UML diagrams representing our application, which was very useful, especially when it came to writing the code.</p>
							<p>During the actual code development, we continued with the same areas of responsibility initially. Once the basic code had been written, we ensured everything interfaced and worked together. Towards the end of development, we adjusted our code according to what was required, which is also where we started to do whitebox testing, as well as using libraries such as bandit and pylama to test for vulnerabilities and syntax.</p>
							<p>Overall, I am very happy with how we approach this team assignment. We separated the work equally and updated each other on progress using WhatsApp, Trello, Slack, and Github. Given the fact that, in the previous module, one of our assignments was also a coding project, we all had goals as to what we wanted to do differently this time. For instance, at the end of the last module, I focused on creating a minimum-viable product before considering what other features I could add. This is something I brought up quite early in the team meetings, and we continued to focus on that throughout the planning and development. In doing so, we created enough “buffer” time to include other features, such as the download service, because we had focused on fulfilling the requirements first.</p>
							<h2>Learning Process & Knowledge Application</h2>
							<p>As per usual, I was planning to apply the knowledge I have gained some time in the future, especially once I graduate. However, applying the knowledge of this module, specifically, came in handy immediately after submitting the coding assignment. As part of my job, I am responsible for creating and maintaining air traffic control simulator exercises. This involves processing large amounts of data in relatively short amounts of time. Working for a government entity, this also means ensuring that said data is kept securely and regularly updated, as well as ensuring that backups are taken.</p>
							<p>Following what I’ve learnt in the last two modules, I created two simple Python applications with tkinter GUIs - one for scheduling and automating backups and a second application that can process flight plan data and turn it into simulator-compatible files. I am planning to extend these applications further, eventually turning them into a web application of sorts. Knowing what I’ve learnt throughout this module, I know which vulnerabilities to look out for. Funnily enough, I discovered a vulnerability within our company network just a few weeks into this module, based on what I had learnt in the first few units.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>My biggest problem, “chronic overthinking”, was not something I encountered during this module. However, I am unsure whether I can credit this to the changes I have made or because it was a very team-focused module, which meant that not the entire responsibility was placed on the shoulders of just one.
							I thoroughly enjoyed reading this module’s core text, as it taught a lot, not only about software architecture and design patterns but also about how to write secure code (Pillai, 2017). In addition to course literature, I decided to delve a little further into cryptography and found Samuel Browne’s book on cryptography with Python a useful reference, as it teaches the core concepts of password hashing (Browne, 2018). I plan to continue to learn more about security in a computer science context, and I’m looking forward to seeing what will be taught in the next modules.</p>
