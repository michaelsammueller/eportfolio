							<h1>Unit 7: Artefacts</h1>
							<h2 class="align-center">Data Structures</h2>
							<p class="align-center">Task: Discuss the ways in which data structures support object-oriented development. Use examples of three different data structures to contextualise your response.</p>
							<p>Generally speaking, computer programs require data structures to support their operation. These data structures, as their name suggests, store data which a program requires to function. There are, of course, various ways in which data can be stored. Although there are many more data structures, I consider the following four among the most important. This, of course, heavily depends on the task at hand.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Lists</b> - Lists are among the most basic data structures, but also among the most powerful. Lists allow for sequential storage of data, such as a collection of callsigns, aircraft types in a fleet, car brands sold in a dealership, etc. Depending on the amount of data stored, lists can be very quickly searched based on index. However, they can also be iterated over unitl the desired value is found, in case the index is unknown.</li>
								<li><b>Tuples</b> - Tuples are comparable to lists in the sense of how they are defined within Python. The main difference between the two is that, while lists can be altered, tuples are immutable - meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. This might be useful in an object-oriented context if you are storing data within a class that will never change. This also means that this collection of data cannot be changed accidentally.</li>
								<li><b>Dictionaries</b> - Dictionaries are, in my opinion, among the most useful data structures in an object-oriented context. While designing my system for the assignment in Unit 7, I heavily depended on dictionaries. Dictionaries allow you to store data in a key:value pair. This means that the data in a dictionary can be very easily accessed if the key is known. If you create a "Car" class which is initialized with data every car will have, such as brand, make, engine, seats, mirrors, gears, etc., it will be very easy to access the required data later. Since dictionaries use hash tables to provide constant-time access to their data based on the keys, searching them is much faster compared to other data structures.</li>
								<li><b>Queues</b> - Queues work on a first-in-first-out principle, like a queue does in real life. If you are the first to queue, you will be the first to leave the queue. This can be useful in an object-oriented program, such as a navigational system, where the first waypoint on a route will be the first one to be removed from the queue. From a data search perspective, however, searching a queue is arguably the least efficient out of the four, as you have to iterate over each item in a queue, where the items will not be in any particular order, and cannot be sorted, like they could in a list.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Although the task only asked for three data structures, the above four are the ones I considered when working on my system design. They all have their pros and cons, and, depending on context and requirement, only some will prove to be useful. Regardless, they all provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data, which greatly supports the object-oriented paradigm, as well as reusability of code, since these sturctures can store all kinds of variables and are not restricted to a certain type at a time.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2 class="align-center">Nested Dictionary</h2>
							<p class="align-center">Task: Create a nested dictionary of data on cars within a Car class. Extend the program to work with the dictionary by calling the following methods:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>items()</li>
								<li>keys()</li>
								<li>values()</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/unit7_program.png" alt="" class="center"></span>
							<p>Within the "Car" class, I defined a nested dictionary called "parts_info", which stores some data about parts in the car. The "__init__" method initializes an instance of the class with "make, model, engine, and seats" information. The "parts()", "brands()", and "types()" methods return the data as required by the task. To only return the requested data, without any prefix, I convert every returned dictionary into a list. Calling these three methods results in the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>print(car.parts())</b> - [('Heater', {'Bosch': 'X673'}), ('Operating System', {'Android': 'Cotton Candy'}), ('Lights', {'Philips': 'Hue'})]</li>
								<li><b>print(car.brands())</b> - ['Heater', 'Operating System', 'Lights']</li>
								<li><b>print(car.types())</b> - [{'Bosch': 'X673'}, {'Android': 'Cotton Candy'}, {'Philips': 'Hue'}]</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 class="align-center">Initial Coding Sketches and Ideas</h2>
							<h4>Pathfinding/Navigation</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Navigation system is idle and shows current location of the car</li>
								<li>User inputs destination</li>
								<li>Navigation system calculates proposed route</li>
								<li>System sends trip data to Energy Consumption system, including maximum speed on route and height data of trip</li>
								<li>System waits for feedback</li>
								<li>If ECS returns okay, system suggests route to user</li>
								<li>If ECS returns “negative”, system suggests route to nearest “petrol” station.</li>
								<li>User confirms/declines</li>
								<li>System triggers sensor check to analyze surroundings</li>
								<li>If no obstacles detected, system begins navigation</li>
								<li>Sensors running in infinite loop to check for obstacles</li>
								<li>If sensors triggered, car issues avoiding action or activates breaks</li>
								<li>Once destination has been reached, car stops and alerts user.</li>
								<li>System stores this drive in its database - Dictionary - key:value pairs, i.e. : <b>rides = {”05/03”2023”:{”Trip1”:”43.2”, “Trip2”:”32.5”}, “06/03/2023”:{”Trip1”:”21.2”}}</b></li>
							</ul>

							<hr />
							<h4>Predictive Maintenance</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>System is activated when the car is turned on</li>
								<li>System instructs sensors to check car parts (engine/battery, breaks, tire pressure, sensors, cameras etc.)</li>
								<li>System waits for feedback from sensors</li>
								<li>System calculates part percentage based on feedback</li>
								<li>System calculates expected usage based on historical driving data and current parts condition</li>
								<li>System outputs expected maintenance date</li>
								<li>When mechanic performs maintenance, they reset the “rides” dictionary in the navigation system</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/predictive_sketch.png" alt="" class="center"></span>
							<hr />
							<h4>Energy Consumption</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>System activated when car is turned on</li>
								<li>Energy level is checked</li>
								<li>System enters idle mode</li>
								<li>User inputs destination into navigation system</li>
								<li>Navigation system triggers energy consumption system</li>
								<li>Navigation system sends distance data and time data</li>
								<li>Energy consumption system calculates expected energy usage</li>
								<li>If energy is enough for expected ride, system returns an "OK"</li>
								<li>If energy is not enough, system returns a "NEGATIVE"</li>
								<li>If energy is below 20%, car notifies user</li>
