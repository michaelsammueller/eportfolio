							<h1>Unit 7: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Admittedly, for the first time ever, I spent a lot of time looking into debugging and error handling. I really enjoyed learning about how to raise custom errors, how to catch errors and handle them during program run-time to avoid crashes, and how to debug a piece of software efficiently. Working on my assignment for this Unit was very enjoyable, as I used UML for the first time to plan an entire system and it's inner workings. I really appreciate the ease of use of UML, as the design process was very smooth and straight forward. Working on this assignment and using UML gave me the confidence to say that I have understood the content of the previous modules.</p>
							<hr />
							<h2 class="align-center">About the assignment</h2>
							<p>When I first started thinking about what I wanted to do for my assignment, I brainstormed and considered working on the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Pathfinding/Navigation System</b> - The user inputs a destination and the car calculates the perfect path for it to take. Once the path has been calculated, the pathfinding system will instruct the car to start moving on this path.</li>
								<li><b>Energy/Fuel Monitoring System</b> - Based on the path calculated, the car will calculate how much energy/fuel it will need. If the energy/fuel that will be consumed exceeds the amount left in its battery/fuel tank, the car will either reject the path and recalculate, or alert the user that teh car has to be recharged/refueled.</li>
								<li><b>Automated Braking System/Obstacle Detection</b> - Based on sensory feedback, the car will automatically deploy its brakes to avoid contact with an obstacle in front of the car (or behind, if traveling in reverse).</li>
								<li><b>Adaptive Cruise Control/Speed Control</b> - The car varies its speed, i.e. adapts its cruise control settings depending on the traffic situation. This means that, if the cruise control was set to 100 km/h when the roads were clear, the car will automatically slow down to avoid traffic in front, by matching the speed with the vehicle in front of itself.</li>
								<li><b>Lane Control System</b> - Based on sensor and camera feedback, the car will be able to recongize lane markings and keep itself steady within the confines of a lane. The car can also change lanes automatically if necessary.</li>
								<li><b>Traffic Signs/Light Recognition System</b> - Using its cameras and computer vision, the car is able to recognize street signs while traveling or while stationary. This allows the vehicle to conform to the laws of the road.</li>
								<li><b>Part Performance Monitoring System</b> - The car, using information and data provided by its sensors, should calculate how likely it's parts are to fail, based on historical trip data and part lifetimes. This way, the car can alert the user via a notification that the car will need maintenance on a specific date.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Ultimately, I decided that my main three operations would be "Route Planning", "Energy Monitoring", and "Predictive Maintenance". I am happy that I brainstormed and kept record of all of my ideas, because this allowed me to collect references for every system and make an informed decision quite easily. I am so satisfied with how I approached this assignment, that I would do it exaclty the same way next time.</p>
							<p>I also appreciate the way I approached research. In the past, I would sometimes decide on what I want to do and then look for references, which sometimes results in dead ends. This time, I decided to first perform research about various smart car/driverless car systems, and then pick out the systems I was interested in. This way I had references before I even decided what I wanted to do. If you want to know more about my initial coding sketches or research, click <a href="unit7_artefacts.html">here.</a></p>
