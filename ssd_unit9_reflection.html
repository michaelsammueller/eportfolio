							<h1>Unit 9: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Only a few more weeks to go until we present our product. Honestly, if someone had asked me how I thought I would be feeling at this point, I definitely would have assumed more nervosity. As I have mentioned in my previous reflections, the team I have been assigned to has managed to work together very well. We all come from different backgrounds with different experiences and interests, which is a fact we were able to use to our advantage. Our product, as little as it may seem, has many facets. Whether it is data, security, concurrency, or documentation - there are many aspects to focus on. This meant that we were able to exploit this and use it to our advantage by volunteering for parts we were fully (or somewhat) confident in.</p>
							<p>I do, however, think it important to mention that none of us relied on previous experience to sail through this assignment comfortably. As part of the project, we all were faced with problems we had never encountered before, allowing us to step outside of our comfort zones and expose ourselves to entirely new worlds of code development. For instance, I had previously never worked with encryption or password hashing before because it is not something I am usually exposed to, neither professionally nor within my private projects. This meant I got to learn about libraries like ‘cryptography’ or ‘bcrypt’, something I am incredibly thankful for. Not only are they very easy to set up and use, but they add an extraordinary amount of functionality to Python code with very few lines.</p>
