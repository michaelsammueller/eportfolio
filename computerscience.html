							<p>This module provides a high-level introduction/overview of the topics covered in greater detail in other modules in the Master's programme, as well as aspects you will encounter during your career in Computer Science.</p>
							<p>The intention of this module to explore and investigate the fundamental theories and practices of computing. You will then gradually explore the trends and current legislative, regulatory and ethical developments in the field of computer science, which are used to minimise computer technology related threats and personal data breaches.<a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/course/view.php?id=8892&section=0">(University of Essex Online)</a></p>
							<h2><u>Reading & Notes</u></h2>
							<blockquote>Implementing cybersecurity has software, hardware and human compoments.</blockquote>
							<p><b>Viruses:</b> Ususally only try to copy themselves into other programs on the infected machine. Other, more malicious viruses, might attempt to degrade portions of the OS, erasing large blocks of data or otherwise corrupting programs and data.</p>
							<p><b>Worms:</b> Worms, like viruses, can be programmed to replicate themselves in order to infect programs or other machines via network. A worm "explosion" can overload entire systems, networks, or the entire internet.</p>
							<p><b>Trojan Horses:</b> A trojan horse is a malware disguised as a legitimate program, such as a game, which is willingly downloaded by the victim. Once installed, trojan horses start their activities immediately, or lie dormant until triggered by a specific event (specific time, date, etc.). Trojan horses often come as attachments in emails.</p>
							<p><b>Spyware:</b> This malware (also known as spiffing software) collects data about the victim. Keyloggers are a popular example of spyware.</p>
							<p><b>Phishing:</b> Phishing is obtaining information by simply asking for it. A common practice of phishing is emailing victims and spoofing them (i.e. claiming to be someone you are not), asking them to share bank details, OTPs or to transfer money.</p>
							<p><b>DoS and DDoS:</b> Denial of Service (Dos) attacks are attacks that overload a computer or server, by flooding the system with requests/messages via computer. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks compromise a target by flooding it with requests from multiple systems, also known as bot nets.</p>
							<blockquote>Phishing, viruses and other attacks have human and software components.</blockquote>
							<ul>
							<li>Antivirus software and firewalls can help prevent unauthorized access to private data.</li>
							<li>Cryptography is essential to many models of cybersecurity</li>
							<li>The backbone of HTTPS is the TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, a successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</li>
							<li>Standards for sharing information and communicating between browsers and servers on the Web include HTTP and secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS)</li>
							<li>Cryptography has a mathematical foundation</li>
							<li>Symmetric encryption is a method of encryption involving one key for encryption and decryption</li>
							<li>Open standards help ensure cryptography is secure</li>
							<li>Public key encryption, which is not symmetric, is an encryption method that is widely used because of the enhanced security associated with its use</li>
							<li>Certificate Authorities (Cas) issue digital certificates that validate the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communications and are based on a trust model</li>
							<li>Privacy and security concerns arise in the development and use of computational systems and artifacts</li>
							<li>Technology enables the collection, use and exploitation of information about, by and for individuals, groups and institutions.</li>

							<h2>The BCS Code of Conduct - 4 Key Principles</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><b>You make IT for everyone</b> - No discrimination</li>
								<li><b>Show what you know, learn what you don't</b> - Only work within your competence, never claim a level of competence you do not possess</li>
								<li><b>Respect the organization or individual you work for</b> - Work in the best interest of your employer and take personal/collective responsibility for your actions</li>
								<li><b>Keep IT real. Keep IT professional. Pass IT on</b> - Support your colleagues in their growth. Accept personal duty to uphold the reputation of the profession, IT and the BCS</li>
