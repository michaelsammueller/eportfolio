							<h1>Unit 4: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Unit 4 was very interesting, as it introduced two concepts - Regex and Recursion. I was already familiar with recursion, as it was one of the topics taught during the last module, "Object-Oriented Programming". I had also heard of regex before, but I had never really used it. Whenever I was watching Python tutorials online, people would always talk about regex and importing the "re" library into Python, but I never really understood what that actually meant. Albeit my somewhat flimsy grasp on regex going into this unit, coming out of it I can proudly say that it all makes sense, and it is actually much simpler than I thought. Simpler in the sense of "I understand what regex can do", not necessarily in the sense of "Regex expressions are simple", as those can get very complicated.</p>
							<p>Throughout this week, I felt much more comfortable with the "team project" concept. Getting to know my team mates better, as well as working on this project together eased the tension I had initially felt. I am someone who likes to be in control of things, and I work very well on my own. This doesn't mean that I cannot work in teams or do not enjoy it, on the contrary, team projects are some of the most enjoyable parts of a professional work life. When you get sorted into teams, you never now if you will be able to work well together, and if you will be on the "same wave length" as the others, which ultimately affects the quality of your output. As mentioned in some of my previous reflections, my fellow team members and I seem to be working very well together, and I am confident that we will produce well written and thought out assignments.</p>
