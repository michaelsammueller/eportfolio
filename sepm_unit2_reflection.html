							<h1>Unit 2: Reflection</h1>
							<p>My studies have been going well so far. While I prefer doing practical work, such as coding, I do enjoy learning about the management side of computer science. Having been a witness to many projects during my professional career, it is very interesting to see what goes on behind the scenes, to learn what Project Managers do, and how milestones and such are decided.</p>
                            <p>During the "Secure Software Design" module, I was very unsure about team work, not because I don't enjoy working in a team, but because I didn't know how the time difference and varying schedules would affect the project we were working on. I was positively surprised, as I have mentioned before, how well we worked together. I can't, however, say the same thing about this team yet. My peers don't respond to messages, and one team member is yet to respond to my initial message. I have prepared the team contract based on the "Secure Software Design" module team contract, and have asked my peers to add comments, as well as to sign the contract if and when they are happy with it. Let's see how this continues.</p>
