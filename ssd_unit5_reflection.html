							<h1>Unit 5: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Unit 5 was among the most busy units so far, not because of the material presented, but because of the work that went on behind the scenes. My team met twice this week, once on Sunday as usual, and once on Friday. During these two meetings, we discussed vital aspects of our first submission, and made final decisions regarding the features we would implement. Throughout the last few modules, I sometimes suffered from what I like to call "The problem of a thinker". What I mean by this, is that I tend to overthink. In and of itself, that can be useful at times, because I am usually mentally prepared for anything and everything.</p>
							<p>However, what this also does, is it leads me to plan big, sometimes too big for the time I have to complete a project. Instead of focusing on what I need to fulfill the requirements, I think about how to perfect the software I am planning to build. In my last module, Object-Oriented Programming, we were asked to develop a system that supports the operation of a driverless car. Eventually, I found myself stuck implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm, so that my software would have a true and correctly working path-finding algorithm, that would allow the "car" to traverse a virtual city which I had created. Was that necessary? Probably not. Luckily, I managed to get it finished in time.</p>
							<p>Based on this, one of my resolutions in last module's reflection was not to overthink too much, and focus on the task at hand instead. That is something I've been trying to do throughout this module. To get back to my original point - During our team meetings, my team and I caught ourselves several times thinking too far, beyond our scope, having to remind ourselves to focus on a minimum viable product, and then build on that if we still have time. That way we will meet the requirements within the given time. Let's see where this leads us.</p>
