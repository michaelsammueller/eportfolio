							<h1>Unit 8: Reflection</h1>
							<p>We are now right in the middle of developing code for our summative assessment. I had been worried about how the time differences and differing schedules would affect our team, but we are working together very well. Fortunately for us, we had put a lot of effort into our design document, making the actual development of the code relatively easy and straightforward. Of course, as is always the case when it comes to programming, goals change, new ideas are introduced, and old plans are dropped for something more efficient or easier to implement. After all, we only have a few weeks to get a working version of our product up and running.</p>
							<p>I am glad that we, as a team, decided to follow a microservice architecture approach, allowing us to divide our product into various pieces. This means that we can work on different aspects of the application simultaneously, which wouldnâ€™t really work if we had decided to follow a more monolithic approach. Though one may argue that, for a small application developed by a small team, this approach would have been the better one. However, I would disagree with that argument. The flexibility microservices bring to the table regarding product development is, in my opinion, unbeatable.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, following an object-oriented programming paradigm has made development very comfortable.</p>
