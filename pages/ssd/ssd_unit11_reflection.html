							<h1>Unit 11: Reflection</h1>
							<p>We are now getting really close to our code demonstration. Throughout the past few weeks, we’ve been working hard at implementing as many features as we possibly could while also focusing on security and performance.
							We’re developing an application which, in theory, would be deployed on a computer on the International Space Station. This means that access to this application would be very limited, as only the ISS crew could access it. We are not planning to allow remote connections yet, which gives us some leeway, as we do not have to focus on implementing network protocols or protecting against network-focused attacks. 
							</p>
							<p>I was able to implement the download service, which allows a user to download their health records from the application’s database directly into their download folder. Since the ISS uses Windows and Linux machines, I ensured this functionality would work regardless of which operating system would be used.</p>
							<p>Addendum: We had our code demonstration today, and although we did not manage to demonstrate all of the features we have implemented, I would still say it was successful. The moderator pointed out some issues, some of which we plan to address before submitting the code on Monday. Given that we only had about 4 weeks to put our plan into practice, we did quite well; at least, that’s what I think. Sometimes I find it quite difficult to stop myself from adding more and more features. My team and I had many ideas we could have implemented if we had more time. This, however, is one of the challenges of completing such assignments. We found it very useful to focus on a “minimum viable product”, so to say, allowing us to focus on the features needed to fulfil the requirements first before looking elsewhere at other features we could implement. Within this code submission, we have a "Readme" file which details all the changes we've made to the final implementation, compared to the design. We have also included an extensive section on testing.</p>
