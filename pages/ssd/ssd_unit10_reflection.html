							<h1>Unit 10: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Just one more week until our code demonstration. Thankfully, we are at a stage where we can test our code, and most of the development has finished. This means we can now focus on the “nice-to-haves”, which we had put aside early on. My team is still meeting regularly, once every Sunday and Wednesday, allowing us to discuss progress and problems - a process which, so far, has worked very well for us.</p>
							<p>Currently, our system is able to perform the basic CRUD operations, as well as perform encryption, authentication, hashing and input sanitisation. We have connected our database, allowing us to store any of the CRUD artefacts, as well as concurrent logging events, which will be finalised throughout the week. This gives us some time to work on our “regular” unit work, such as lecturecasts, reading, and group discussions, as well as on our e-Portfolio. One thing I want to focus on this week is to improve the UI of our program so that it looks nice, albeit being a simple CLI. I also want to look into creating a “Download Service”, which would allow users to assemble and download all health records they have created, possibly as a password-protected PDF or “.txt” file. I am unsure whether I will be able to create this in time for Thursday, but right now, it does not seem like a big deal.</p>
							<p>This, however, is one of the traps of coding - “That’ll be easy” or “Yeah, that’s no problem” are famous last words when it comes to code development. Still, I find that to be one of the most enjoyable aspects of programming. You, the programmer, are faced with a problem that requires a solution. You think of an approach, try, fail, recoup and try again. Maybe you succeed this time but know that if you can solve this problem differently, your program will run more efficiently. It is a never-ending cycle of “Can this be improved” which I personally find very satisfying.</p>
