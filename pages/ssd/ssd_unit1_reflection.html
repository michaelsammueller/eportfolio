							<h1>Unit 1: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Unit 1 served as a great introduction to secure software development. This time around, I tried to focus on a day-by-day approach, rather than looking too far ahead. Doing so, in my opinion, always comes with a risk of overthinking. I did, as always, look at the assignment requirements, and was surprised that this module included a team project. The first two modules I studied did not include any team work, apart from the collaborative discussion forums. At this point, I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it is great to work in a team, to be able to share experiences and ideas, and to simulate what a professional workplace may look like. On the otherhand, when working in a team, you have to rely on others, and it might be difficult to plan or schedule things, especially when working across time zones.</p>
							<p>Update: As we move along with this week, my team and I have been in contact and met last Sundway via video chat. This gave us a great opportunity to get to know each other, and discuss the two assignments we will have to complete together. This reassured me, and gave me the confidence to move ahead. Sometimes it can be nerve-wrecking to have a group project with people you have not previously worked with, but I am confident in saying that my team members will be great to work with.</p>
