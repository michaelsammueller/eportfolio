							<h1>Unit 4: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Wow. I received a distinction for my last assignment. That's great! Now I can focus on the next two assignments - The "Executive Summary" for my vulnerability audit, and the individual reflection we need to write. I am really looking forward to using all these tools to scan the website and see which vulnerabilites I can find. I am going to work really hard to make the executive summary as professional as possible. After submitting the last assignment, this week is a welcome "breather" before I have to start working hard on these next assignments. Like I said before - a six week module is pretty stressful and hectic.</p>
                            <p>After studying network security over the past few weeks, I have really rediscovered my love for cybersecurity. It has always been on my mind, and, like mentioned before, I have used tools and websites before to gain understanding about this topic. I hope that, this time, I will keep at it and potentially earn some cybersecurity certifications as well.</p>
