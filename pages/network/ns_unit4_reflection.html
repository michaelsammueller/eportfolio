							<p>Well, that didn't work out as expected. The grade I received for my assignment isn't what I was aiming for at all. It is exactly as I thought - fitting everything into 600 words is what would be the greatest struggle. It was pointed out that I should have included more detail, but I do not know how I could have accomplished that given the very limited word count. Again, I understand that this is one of the challenges of this assignment, but seeing that the word limit for the 'ReadMe' file for the next assignment is 1200 - double the amount of the risk identification report - makes it seem almost impossible. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback. Moving forward, I will try to adjust my approach so that the same doesn't happen with any future assignments. Sure, I am disappointed, but I won't let that stop me.</p>
