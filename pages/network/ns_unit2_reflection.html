							<h1>Unit 2: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>Unit 2 has been very interesting, as it introduced the concept of the Cyber Kill Chain. I had never heard of this before, so it was fascinating to learn about it. I've really enjoyed this module so far, as it has reignited my love for Kali Linux and pen-testing. I cannot wait to actually get started with scanning the website that has been assigned to me for vulnerabilities.</p>
                            <p>I have been travelling for the past few weeks, and will continue to travel for the coming week. Studying at Uni Essex makes it relatively easy to balance my academic life with my private life. Although, to be quite honest, travelling during a 6-week module is a little more challenging than travelling during a 12-week module. The deadlines are closer together, and so it seems like you have much more to do in a much shorter amount of time. I am ready for the challenge. Let's see how this goes.</p>
