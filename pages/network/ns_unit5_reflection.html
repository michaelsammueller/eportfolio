							<h1>Unit 5: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>I have spent most of this week working on the Executive Summary of my vulnerability analysis. I tried to follow the Gantt chart, which I had included in the baseline analysis, as closely as possible. First, I started with performing various scans with the tools I had proposed in the baseline document. While doing so, I encountered an issue with the Greenbone OpenVAS, causing me to diverge from my initial plan and employ another tool, skipfish, instead. Basically, I tried to perform as many different scans as possible, in order to form a clear picture.</p>
                            <p>After performing the first few scans, it became quite clear that, although the scans tend to pick up the same vulnerabilities, they sometimes detect potential flaws and exploits that other scans do not detect. I also noticed that the ranking of these vulnerabilities differs based on which program you use. For example, some scanners rated a hostname mismatch on the SSL certificate as a 'low' risk vulnerability, while others rated it as a 'medium' vulnerability. I therefore decided that, for my report, I would strictly follow my rating scheme which I had proposed. That way, I would be able to keep consistent throughout the report.</p>
                            <p>The next step was to gather all of my results and greate graphs for each individual scan, as well  as one graph/chart to summarize the findings. I then compared my results to GDPR, and discovered that, because AbanteCart has no privacy policy, they are in violation of the GDPR. I tried to find as much standard violations as possible, in order to warn AbanteCart of potential fines (which seemingly could reach millions of euros).</p>
                            <p>My work has been particularly stressful these past two weeks, so keeping focused on both studies and work was quite a challenge, but I like to think that I handled it well. I ensured to always spend at least an hour or two per day on university during the week, and even more time on weekends.</p>
