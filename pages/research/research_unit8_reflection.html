							<h1>Unit 8: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>It felt good to finally have the first assignment behind us, although now the inevitable wait for the grades begins. I have had a good feeling so far and I am proud of my work, so I think I should do well. I will find out soon, hopefully. Besides that, it was great to focus on visualizing data this week, as this will be a valuable skill to possess when creating documentation for our master's thesis. I have also spent a lot of time thinking and planning my thesis, so I feel like I am on the right track and making good progress. I have also been working tirelessly on my research proposal presentation, as I want the visuals to compliment what I will be saying during the presentation. The good thing about PowerPoint is that you can write your speaking points directly into the software, so you can see them while you are presenting. I have also selected a theme which goes well with the topic at hand. I have created most of the major slides and am working on finishing the last few. Over the past 1 1/2 years, I have come to appreciate working ahead, so I always have some buffer in case a task takes longer than expected.</p>
