							<h1>Unit 9: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>I have received feedback for my assignment, but I am still waiting for the grade. To be honest, I am a little bit unhappy about the feedback, because there are some points I disagree with. However, I have decided to wait for the grade before doing anything else. Besides that, other than completing the tasks which had been assigned to us for this week, most of my time was spent working on the Research Proposal Presentation, which is due next Monday. I am quite happy with it so far, and the only thing left is to add and configure animations and transitions, and then to record the presentation. I have a good feeling about it, having planned my work in a way where I have a lot of buffer in case of last minute changes.</p>
                            <p>I have also had a few calm days at work, allowing me to spend some time working on my assignment. I have also come up with two artefacts for my actual thesis project, and I am excited to get started working on them.</p>
