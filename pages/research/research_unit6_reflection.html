							<h1>Unit 6: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>I found this unit to be very interesting, because we learnt about different data visualization methods and how to use Excel and its inbuilt formulas to analyze and compare data. Besides this, I spent several hours working on my Literature Review which is due next Monday. In my opinion it has been going quite well, since I prepared for it. Searching for literature first and collecting references before writing really does help a lot. Now I can focus on comparing current research, identify gaps and formulate my own arguments, rather than lookign for literature to prove my points. I do, however, know that I will need to cut down on my review - I am currently about half way done and I have already written around 1,300 words. The word limit is 2,000. I understand why we get such restrictive word limits, but I feel like they are too restrictive some times, especially when you are writing about a topic with a lot of pre-existing literature.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I think I have now found the topic I want to talk about for my final project - GPS Spoofing. GPS Spoofing is a major threat for the aviation and air traffic control industry at the moment, and although there are some concepts and theories that discuss how this problem may be solvable, there is no in-place solution, especially for civil aviation.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/research/spoofing.jpg" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <p>I don't want to go into too much detail now, as I am currently awaiting a response from a potential supervisor.</p>
