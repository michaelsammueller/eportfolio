							<h1>Unit 11: Artefacts</h1>
							<h2 class="align-center">Unit 11 Reading</h2>
							<p class="align-center">As in every unit, we were tasked to read several websites/papers, specifically on the topic of ePortfolios in educational and professional environments. I had some thoughts whilst reading through some of the papers, so I decided to record them below. This will also be part of my final reflection.</p>
                            <h3 class="align-center">Notes</h3>
                            <p>In her article titled “Employer Perceptions of an Engineering Student’s Electronic Portfolio”, Weber (2018) speaks about a gap between the skills students learn at college and the needs of an employer. I agree with said statement, however, I would add that there are fundamental skills most students lack in terms of knowledge they will require in the future. For instance, I am not aware of any student in my generation, whether in the German or the British system, who learns how to file taxes, how the stock market works, or the importance of preparing for one's retirement, to name a few.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Furthermore, based on personal experience, I do find ePortfolios to be a valuable tool for self-reflection and evaluation. Creating and updating such a portfolio is a skill that is acquired through consistency and time. Sometimes, however, I find that the grading of such portfolios defeats the purpose altogether. A portfolio should be a place for a student to reflect honestly and in a way which befits them, similarly to a diary - at least to a certain extent (Hoven et al., 2022). Once grading is introduced, the student may feel compelled to say specific things and omit others. For instance, Miller & Morgaine (2009) argue that faculties and institutions can use student ePortfolios to improve their course material. However, I find it doubtful whether students reflect their true opinions on course material, since their portfolios are not anonymous and they rely on their tutors for grades. Furthermore, the additional work of creating and maintaining an ePortfolio may be seen as a distraction, or be overwhelming to some students (Händel et al., 2018).</p>
