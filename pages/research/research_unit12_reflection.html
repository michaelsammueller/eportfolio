							<h1>Unit 11: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>It is actually very refreshing to see how far I have come. Looking back at the reflections I had written for the first few units, I felt like I would never come up with a valuable topic I could research and create an artefact for. What was most important for me was to find something that had not yet been done in the way I imagin it, yet, simultaneously, be useful. It is all about the process at the end of the day. In German we have a saying - "Der Weg ist das Ziel" - which translated verbatim means - "The way is the goal" - but what it is trying to convey is that it is the progress you make whilst trying to achieve your goal, which is what eventually leads to achieving the goal. Although this seems quite obvious, it may not always be, especially not with large projects that may seem overwhelming at first.</p>
                            <p>Not only does this apply to professional or educational contexts, but also to your life in general. I, as do many others, tend to overthink and worry about things which are out of my control. What I have learned is to trust the process. Take it step by step. Day by day. Eventually, I will reach my goal, and everything I can control, I will do my best to ensure the success of my aims. However, if there is an aspect I cannot control, then why should I break my head over it? I guess in terms of risk assessments, this is what is called risk acceptance.</p>
