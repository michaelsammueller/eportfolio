							<h1>Unit 5: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>There has been some public holidays, so I had a few days to purely focus on my studies. I have now narrowed my ideas for my actual master's thesis to the following three:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How machine learning models could improve customer satisfaction at major international airports</li>
                                <li>A new threat: How cyberattacks endanger global airport operations</li>
                                <li>How AI/Computer Systems can aid Air Traffic Controllers in providing a safe airspace</li>
                            </ul>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/research/brainstorming.JPG" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <p>As you might have noticed, all three of these topics are heavily aviation focused. That is because I am currently employed with the Qatari Civil Aviation Authority, and aviation in general is one of my passions. I would therefore like to conduct some research in this field. Additionally, as I work in the field, I have access to many primary sources, both from Air Traffic Control, as well as from Airport Operations. I also have contacts to Air Traffic Control Simulation providers. Since I work in the Training Department, I also have access to several ATC simulators, which would allow me to collect data, test hypotheses, and test potential software or machine learning models I would create. I feel like that is why the third idea is probably the best for me to focus on.</p>
                            <p>Besides that, I am still waiting for feedback on my literature review outline. I wanted to wait with writing my actual literature review for the first assignment until I have recieved feedback, to avoid focusing on something that the tutor deems worthless. However, time is running short, and I only have two weeks to complete my literature review, so I have decided to get started anyway.</p>
