							<h1>Unit 7: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>This unit seemed a little calmer than the preceding ones. Although there was much to do in case of reading, lecture cast, worksheets, and discussion forum posts, it still gave me enough time to polish my literature review. After I had received the feedback from the tutor, I incorporated a few changes into it, in the hopes of receiving a higher mark once it is graded. I thoroughly enjoyed writing this literature review, as well as planning it. I find myself to be quite the writer, and research is certainly one of my passions, which is why I am actually looking forward to getting started on my dissertation, although it is a little intimidating when you think about it.</p>
                            <p>I am currently in contact with a supervisor whom I would really like to work with for my dissertation, so I am eagerly awaiting how this progresses. He appeared to have liked my initial idea, but I am sure there will be a few changes along the way - that is the joy of study after all. Although we are working with Excel,  and yes, I know - it is a research module - I am missing programming a lot.</p>
                            <h3>Update:</h3>
                            <p>I have just received feedback for my literature review, and although I don't fully agree with the feedback, I am satisfied with my grade. Overall, I feel that I have met all the requirements. For instance, although I concur with the fact that my analysis of cyberterrorism was approached from quite a broad perspective, I felt that was necessary to adequately cover all points encompassed by the title which I had chosen based on a list of topics provided to us by the university. To discuss how governments both benefit and suffer from cyberterrorism requires a broad approach, as this theme covers a wide range of topics, such as cyberterrorism, cyber warfare, and cyber espionage. Furthermore, although focusing on one country in particular may have given me more room to reflect on this particular case in greater detail, I felt that, to successfully contrast current academic opinion on the topic required the inclusion of at least three to four countries, as academic opinion varies greatly depending on the country discussed. For instance, opinion on western countries, such as the United States, overwhelmingly points to defense and security as an explanation for US cyber terrorism (Ardita et al., 2023). Often, authors even avoid using the term terrorism in conjunction with western countries altogether. However, in terms of countries like Russia, China, or North Korea, the finger-pointing is much more noticable, with Russia being accussed of information warfare (Topor & Tabachnik, 2021), China being accused of cyber espionage (Hore & Raychaudhuri, 2020), and North Korea being accused of cyberterrorism (Hwang & Choi, 2021).</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, according to how I interpreted the assignment guidelines, I understood that we were tasked to reflect on the research design and research methods used by the authors and papers we were reviewing in our literature review, not to come up with our own, which seems to have been the incorrect interpretation. I also believe that I was very critical and clearly stated, several times, that I consider some of the behaviour mentioned by all listed countries to be destructive in nature, hence I chose them as examples for state-sponsored cyberterrorism.</p>
