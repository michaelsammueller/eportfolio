							<h1>Meeting 5 Notes</h1>
                            <p>As mentioned on the home page for this module, the meeting notes were generated using Zoom's AI summary feature. Some of these notes have been altered for accuracy.</p>
							<h3>Quick Recap</h3>
                            <p>Tarek, Michael, Brad, and Haaris discussed the lack of constraints on their project, the threat of a lawsuit from EDC, and discrepancies in the planning document. They decided to adjust their delivery plan and selling price to meet EDC's requirements. The team also addressed hardware and operating system requirements and discrepancies in their planning and production timeline. They acknowledge a significant amount of back and forth in estimating requirements for Assignment 2, which seems to overalp with the work already done in Assignment 1. The team agreed to clarify expectations with the professor in the coming days.</p>
                            <h3>Final Project RUnthrough</h3>
                            <p>The team performed a final run through their project and discussed the requirements in detail. They agreed to submit a Python application and a 10-slide Powerpoint presentation. The team also decided to propose two systems in response to the assignment requirements - one based on the original design, and a new system that fully satisfies EDC's requirements. Haaris suggested creating a Google Doc to outline their plans and Brad agreed. They also discussed the 20-minute presentation they needed to prepare and debated whether the Python application was the main part of their submission or just a supplement/addition. After going through the transcript, they agreed to focus on the components and manpower required for the project, and Tarek clarified that they needed to create a fully costed plan for both systems. They also debated whether a section in the transcript was relevant to their assignment, wiht Haaris suggesting they focus on chapters 5 and appendix 1 and 2.</p>
                            <h3>Project Deliverable: Adjusting System for EDC CHallenges</h3>
                            <p>Michael, Tarek, and Brad discussed their project focusing on the second deliverable, which involves addressing the EDC challenges. They deliberated on adjusting their system based on the complaints from EDC, and incorporating the new system into their budget plan. There was some uncertainty about whether to refer to the existing system or to start fresh, but they eventually agreed to modify the existing system to meet EDC's requirements. They also discussed the shipping model specification decided by Collin Syns, which was sent to EDC for evaluation. The team needs to make a decision and determine how to incorporate the new system within their budget.</p>
                            <h3>System Requirements and EDC Upgrade Discussion</h3>
                            <p>Brad, Michael, and Tarek deliberated on the system requirements, with Tarek proposing the idea of selling the system in three or more batches, instead of two. They also discussed the EDC requirements, agreeing to consider an upgrade path that wouldn't include physical components but would allow necessary modifications. The team decided to add a new board supporting high-resolution graphics, 3-channel sound, and the ability to run older games through an emulator. The price for the upgraded machine was also discussed, with a consensus to add a small premium to accommoddate the changes in specification.</p>
                            <h3>Project Constraints, Lawsuit Threat, and Planning Discrepancies</h3>
                            <p>Tarek, Brad, Michael, and Haaris discussed the lack of constraints on their project, the threat of a lawsuit from EDC, and discrepancies in the planning document. They decided to adjust their delivery plan and selling price to meet EDC's requirements. The team also addressed hardware and operating system requirements and discrepancies in their planning and production timeline. They acknowledged a significant amount of back and forth in estimating requirements for Assignment 2, which seemed to overlap with the work already done for Assignment 1. The team agreed to clarify expectations with the professor.</p>
                            <h3>Arranging a Meeting with the Professor: Logistics and UI DIscussion</h3>
                            <p>Haaris, Tarek, Michael, and Brad discussed the logistics of arranging a meeting with the professor. They decided to send an email asking for a suitable meeting time, clarifying that any day after 5pm British Standard Time would be suitable for them. They also discussed the professor's office hours, which they found unsuitable due to the time difference. They decided to consider dividing their work into program and presentation, and they discussed the need for a user interface for their application. They agreed to use the Tkinter package for their project, considering its simplicity and ease of use.</p>
                            <h3>Data Structure, Storage, and Presentation Preparation</h3>
                            <p>Tarek, Michael, Brad, and Haaris discussed the structure and storage of their project data, deciding to use JSON file structure and a PowerPoint presentation. They also decided to record a 20-minute presentation with a transcript, choosing to upload the audio transcript and PowerPoint presentation. The team considered various methods for recording and uploading the presentation, eventually deciding to edit smaller recordings together. They also discussed the task of preparing a 20-minute presentation with a transcript, dividing the PowerPoint presentation into ten slides and assigning each member three slides. They also discussed the possibility of creating a repository on Github for their work.</p>
                            <h3>Presentation Content Outline and Planning</h3>
                            <p>Tarek, Brad, Michael, and Haaris discussed the content of their upcoming presentation. They outlined the main topics to be covered, including the requirements table, the updated design, the project schedule, mitigation of issues, the new delivery plan, and statistical graphs. They also decided to include a UML model in the presentation. It was decided that Tarek would work on the slides, including the project schedule and the file structure of the Python application. Michael asked for the Github usernames of his colleagues to add them to the repository.</p>
                            <h3>Project Requirements and Ptyhon Application</h3>
                            <p>The team discussed their project's requirements and decided to work on them in the upcoming weeks. Brad proposed working on the project's requirements section and starting on the Python application, while Tarek suggested a plan for two people to work on the Python application and two on the PowerPoint content. Michael, Tarek, and Brad agreed to work on the Python application. The team also discussed the use of classes in their project and whether the code would be graded. They decided to work on cost estimation algorithms and principles.</p>
                            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Haaris will share a Google Slides document for the team to collaborate on.</li>
                                <li>Tarek will work on the project schedule and delivery plan, and also look into the UI of the cost calculator.</li>
                                <li>Michael will work on the classes and methods of the cost calculator.</li>
                                <li>Brad and Haaris will work on the PowerPoint presentation.</li>
                            </ul>
