							<h1>Unit 6: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>The past week has been quite stressful. While we had completed a lot of the work for the Unit 6 Assignment, there were still a few issues we had to sort out. THe main problem we were faced with was the 2-page limit on this assignment. Due to all the tables (such as risk assessment tables, gherkin statement tables, resources tables, hardware and software tables), we had, by far, exceeded the page limit. Over the past few days, we spent a lot of time trying to condense the information in our document without losing too much of the detail it provides.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, we made sure to double-check all of our calculations and hardware and software configurations in order to avoid any mistakes. All of our team members agreed that it was quite difficult to have a complete overview over all the components which make up such a project, which is why project management is such a vital skill to have. I would say that, over time, all of us have gained some experience in managing this project.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, our fifth group member still has not responded to any of our messages.</p>
