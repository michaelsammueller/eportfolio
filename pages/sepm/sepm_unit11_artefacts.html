                            <h2 align="center">The Impact of the low-code and no-code movements on software engineering project management</h2>
                            <p>The conception and rise of low-code/no-code platforms has opened the doors of software engineering to a large percentage of the population that previously was unable to express themselves in this field, due to a lack of coding knowledge and understanding. Popular low-code or no-code platforms such as "Zoho Creator", "Appian", or "Microsoft PowerApps" have enabled coding novices and laymen to create powerful applications to kickstart their businesses, or to support their teams in a professional environment (Marvin, 2018)</p>
                            <h3>Low-code vs no-code</h3>
                            <p>To understand this trend to its fullest extent, we must first discuss the differences between low-code and no-code. Whilst very similar, there are some differences to these two methods that must be made clear before we delve deeper into the future of this movement.</p>
                            <p>As its name suggests, "low-code" refers to a method of creating an application that, at its basis, still requires some knowledge of programming, while "no-code" scratches coding completely off the drawing board, allowing users with little to no programming skills to develop applications (Hurlburt, 2021). Being already very popular, low-code as a business has been growing rapidly. According to a study performed by Quandary Consulting Group, and mentioned by Shuler (2023), the global market for low-code will reach $27 Billion by 2027, and is expected to reach $187 Billion by 2030. They also expect that, by 2025, around 70% of all newly-built enterprise applications will be created using low-code or no-code platforms.</p>
                            <p>Based on this statistic alone, the impact of these two movements becomes obvious, albeit surprising. Having no coding experience is a huge problem for many enterpreneurs who have thought of a great business idea, but cannot build it themselves. One could argue that they can always hire a programmer to programm the application for them - however, that is a costly endeavour, a fact that stops many from continuing to develop their ideas because they do not want to spend that money, or because they do not want to take the risk of hiring a programmer, only for the app not to work out as they expected. It is much less risky to use a no-code platform to at least prototype an application that has some (if not all) functionality. In doing so, a coding novice can create an application and release it, collect user feedback and data, and then decide later whether they would like to hire a programmer to flesh out some of the missing features if the demand is there.</p>
                            <h3>Evolution of no/low-code</h3>
                            <p>Fundamentally, low-code and no-code platforms go back to model-driven engineering, allowing users to use pre-built building blocks to construct the application they have envisioned. Following this principle increases efficiency in software development. In some way, many applications built by your "standard programmer" follow the same principle. Code re-use itself is a huge movement - why reinvent the wheel? Many programmers use open-source code to add features to their programs which have already been created before. There is no need to solve a problem which somebody else has already solved, and platforms like GitHub and StackExchange are filled with such problems and their solutions, all available for free online. Furthermore, the possibility of incorporating AI features into these platforms, allowing users to simply describe what they would like to build, and the AI building it for them, will further increase the popularity of this trend.</p>
                            <h3>Impact on Project Management</h3>
                            <p>As I've mentioned previously, low-code and no-code platforms improve turn-around times, because application development using these platforms is much faster and requires less "engineering" than a normal application. Assuming that each "building block" has also been tested for security, this removes the need for large amounts of testing later, saving valuable project time. Low- and no-code platforms are more accessible, allowing even the project manager, who might not have any experience in coding, to create and work on prototypes, making it easy to follow along for any novice. This removes the "veil" from software engineering, and brakes down the barrier between customer, project manager, and software engineer.</p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>I think it is fair to say that the low-code and no-code movements already have a huge impact, and their impact will continue to increase in the future. It is recommendable to embrace this movement, especially on an enterprise level, and allow people access to platforms such as Microsoft PowerApps as part of their professional office suite, letting them build applications and gain knowledge and expertise in how to use such platforms. Although it removes me, as a programmer, out of the equation,  I think it will not only lead to more applications being built, but it will lead more people to get into coding, because they will, eventually, want more control over their code. Many of these platforms restrict access to the code which they generate under the hood, and allow hosting only on their own platforms, leading to future costs and less control. Depending on the platform, this might have a negative impact on reuse, compatability, and security - all factors that will require further research to be conducted.</p>
