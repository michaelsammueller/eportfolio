							<h1>Unit 5: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Over the past few weeks, I'm glad to say, my team has finally come together to work on our assignment. We were able to split tasks among us, with everyone focusing on a particular area. I have spent a lot of time working on our Gherkin statements, as well as looking into hardware and software configurations. I must say - it was not easy to put a system together, as I found the BOM's for both types of components quite tricky and slightly confusing, but I guess that's part of Project Management. We have decided to create a <i>Google Docs</i> document on the cloud, on which we can collaborate.</p>
                            <p>We are still down one team member, as this member has - so far - not responded to any of our messages. I hope this changes soon, as it would be quite unfortunate for them to miss out on all the team work. Until then, the remaining four, including myself, will work hard in getting something together for the final submission. One aspect we're struggling with is the "2 page" limit, as we find it quite literally impossible to comply to this restriction. Let's see - maybe we can cut some text to come closer to 2 pages. At the moment we have about 27.I have no idea how we will do that.</p>
