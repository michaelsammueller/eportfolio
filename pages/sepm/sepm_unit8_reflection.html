							<h1>Unit 7: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>Having completed all the work for the Unit 6 assignment, I was able to focus entirely on the tasks for Unit 7. It feels refreshing to have completed the first step of this module, although I am not all too confident in the assignment which we have submitted. I have realized that I am more of a practical person than a theoretical one, in the sense that I prefer coding over management theory, but I guess they are both important when it comes to achieving a Master's degree in Computer Science.</p>
                            <p>This is one of the reasons why I really enjoyed the "Secure Software Development" module, because it was what I would describe as a "heavy coding" module. I know that part two of the assignment involves coding, albeit limited. I am eagerly awaiting the feedback for the first assignment, so that my team and I can start developing the presentation and the cost estimation software.</p>
                            <p>I have been thinking a little bit about how the software could look. I imagine that it would be best for us, as a team, to focus on one cost estimation method, such as the "Mythical-Man-Month" or "COCOMO". We could then develop a tkinter-based GUI application that would allow a project manager to enter data and calculate an overall cost estimation. The data the program would require could range from person weeks, cost per hour, cost per occupation and hardware and software costs. </p>
