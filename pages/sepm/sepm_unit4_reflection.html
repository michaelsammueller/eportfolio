							<h1>Unit 4: Reflection</h1>
							<p>When I joined the University of Essex (initially to do a PGCert in Computer Science) over a year ago, I was fascinated by how many students stated that they were travelling whilst studying. I had never done that before, and I honestly could not imagine doing that. This time around, however, I was forced to do it, as I travelled back to Germany for the first time in five years to visit my grandmother for her birthday. I feared that it would be very difficult to balance countless family visits and day-trips with studying and having team meetings, but I have to be honest - it wasn't as difficult as I had imagined it would be.</p>
                            <p>Lucky for me, this unit was very heavy on reading, which is something that can be easily done whilst travelling, whether on the plane, in the car, or whilst sipping on a nice warm cup of coffee at a relatives house. I particularly enjoyed learning about estimation tools and techniques, as this is something I had previously never encountered. I am more familiar with risk planning and mitigation, as this was one of the main topics of the previous module I studied. I am looking forward to learning more about project management in general. Not only will this allow me to enhance my knowledge, but it will also give me insight into what exactly is going on when project planners meet and "plan", as sometimes it looks more like pandora's box than a structured endeavour.</p>
