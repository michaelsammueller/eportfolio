                            <h2 class="align-center">e-Portfolio Activity 1: Scope Creep</h2>
                            <p><b>Task:</b> Answer the following questions:</p>
                            <h4>What is scope creep?</h4>
                            <p>The term scope creep refers to the phenomenon when the scope increases during the project, and eventually includes things which were never meant to be part of the project. As the scope increases, the price of the project will increase and so will the time needed to complete the project.</p>
                            <h4>What aspects of a project are dependent on scope creep?</h4>
                            <p>Time and price, which will affect the number of resources needed and might affect the quality of the project.</p>
                            <h4>How to balance the competing requirements when scope creep occurs?</h4>
                            <p>Communication is key. If the scope increases and more time is needed, then an analysis needs to be done to determine whether the project allows for such a delay to occur.</p>
                            <h4>How do you stop scope creep?</h4>
                            <p>Again, clear communications. As a project manager, you should clearly communicate as to what the scope is and where expectations should be, in order to avoid scope creep from occurring.</p>
                            <p></p>

							<h2 class="align-center">e-Portfolio Activity 2: Improving Code Quality</h2>
							<p><b>Task:</b> Refer to the Mertz (2019) resource. Use some Python code which you have developed in the past and apply at least 3 of the strategies presented at the source to improve its quality.</p>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>After reading through the resource, I dediced to pick 4 strategies which stood out to me:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Indentation:</b> Use 4 spaces per indentation level instead of tabs.</li>
                                <li><b>Line Length:</b> Keep a consistent line length and do not exceed a character limit of 99 characters for code, and 72 characters for comments.</li>
                                <li><b>Arguments:</b> Try to limit your functions to 2 or 3 arguments. Do not exceed line length - if you call a function that requires multiple arguments spanning multiple lines, add an additional layer of indentation.</li>
                                <li><b>Imports:</b> Imports should be at the top of the file in the following order: Standard Packages, Third-Party Packages, and Local Packages. Refrain from using "import *" statements, and do not chain package imports.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>I picked these four strategies because I think they are among the most relevant. Readability of code is of utmost importance, especially when working in a team. If a software engineer, who had nothing to do with the project, were to look at the code, they should be able to at least understand what is going on, even if they don’t necessarily know why. The “why” question should be answered by comments, which is why documenting code thoroughly is also very important.</p>
                            <p>I looked through some of my code files and found that most of them adhered to these strategies mentioned above, thanks to the IDE I use, but also because I have made it a habit to use pylint and flake8 to test my code after I have written it. I did, however, find an old project of mine, which could use some fixing. I had planned to use this python script to generate and schedule backups, automating parts of my day-to-day job. As I had worked on a GUI, the code file itself was quite long, so I broke it down into three sections:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Imports</li>
                                <li>GUI</li>
                                <li>Functions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Imports</h3>
                            <p>Looking at my code, I immediately identified issues that needed to be fixed.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/sepm/unit9/fix%20the%20zen%20-%20imports.png" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <p>The first thing that stands out is that I'm using two types of imports - Standard packages and third-party packages. However, according to the strategies mentioned in Mertz (2019), third-party packages should be imported after standard packages. Furthermore, he mentions that chain imports should not be used. Fixing these issues and adhering to the guide results in the following code:</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/sepm/unit9/fixed%20the%20zen%20-%20imports.png" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <h3>GUI</h3>
                            <p>What catches my eye here is the line length where I add the days of the week. THis has to be reduced beause it is currently exceeding the character limit of 99 characters.</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/sepm/unit9/fix%20the%20zen%20-%20gui.png" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <p>Fixing this resulted in the following code:</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/sepm/unit9/fixed%20the%20zen%20-%20GUI.png" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <h3>Functions</h3>
                            <p>Luckily for me, my functions seemed to be in order:</p>
                            <span class="image main"><img src="../../images/sepm/unit9/fix%20the%20zen%20-%20functions.png" alt="" class="center"/></span>
                            <p>Indentation has been followed properly throughout this code, as this is something Visual Studio Code enforces automatically. Even when the "tab" key is pressed, VS Code adds four spaces to cause indentation, which fits perfectly according to the indentation strategy used in the presentation. Additionally, none of the functions accept more than three arguments.</p>
                            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            <p>Looking back at very old code was somewhat refreshing, as it showed me how far I have come as a software developer and student of computer science. Aspects of coding, such as adhering to the "Zen of Python", which seem so obvious and second nature to me now, used to be completely foreign to me in the beginning. This is exactly what the e-portfolio is for, I guess - to be able to reflect on what I have already learned.</p>
