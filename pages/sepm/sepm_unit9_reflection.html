							<h1>Unit 9: Reflection</h1>
                            <p>Similarly to the last unit, I spent much of this unit working on my tasks for the second assignment. Initially, I reproduced the classes and methods as they had been recorded in the UML Class Diagram I had made for this project. However, whilst doing so, I had already adjusted the code slightly to work better, and removed unnecessary methods and/or attributes that weren't used after all. After one of my team members reviewed my code, he suggested some changes that would improve the overall functionality of the program.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The 'StaffMember' class should include a "work_cap" attribute of some sorts, that records the maximum amount of days said staff member can work. It should also include some form of counter to count how many days said worker has already worked. It should also include some sort of "Capabilities" attribute, in the form of a set, that includes all the skills said worker possesses - for instance: "Hardware Design", "Software Design", "Hardware Manufacturing", etc.</li>
                                <li>The program should automatically assign a staff member to a component, each time a component is added. In doing so, it should calculate the total cost of staff members by calculating how many days each staff member works, and at what rate per day.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>It took me about two hours to include these changes, as well as to adjust my tests in order to reflect the expected outcomes.</p>
                            <p>Besides working on the assignment, I spent a lot of time working on my portfolio. To be frank - When I began my educational journey with the University of Essex, I did not see the point in creating an e-portfolio, and I saw it as more of a way to record notes than to use it as a reflective piece. This becomes quite obvious when you look at the e-portfolio page for the first module "Launching into Computer Science". It mainly consists of notes I had taken throughout the module, with very little reflection on what I had learned. Over time, I have come to appreciate the e-portfolio for what it can do for a student. I actually enjoy writing in it, recording my artefacts, but also looking back at previous units and modules and reflect on what I have already studied. This allows me to appreciate how far I have already come.</p>
