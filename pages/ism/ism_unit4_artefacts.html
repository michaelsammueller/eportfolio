							<h1>Unit 4: Artefacts</h1>
							<h2 class="align-center">E-Portfolio Exercise: Security Standards</h2>
							<p class="align-center">Part of this unit was to answer the following questions:</p>
							<ul>
                                <li>Which of the standards discussed in the sources (above) would apply to the organisation discussed in the assessment? For example, a company providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely by subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.</li>
                                <li>Evaluate the company against the appropriate standards and decide how you would check if standards were being met?</li>
                                <li>What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Answers</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The standard Pampered Pets would have to be compliant with is GDPR, as the business is located in Europe and most likely has customer records on file.</li>
                                <li>Based on the information provided, it is difficult to say whether Pampered Pets meets GDPR standards. It is unclear if they collect sensitive customer data, besides sales data. If Pampered Pets keeps records of its customers, it would be vital to determine whether customers are informed about such data collection occuring, and whether the business ensures that all customer data is deleted upon customer request. It would also be important to know how long such data is kept within the company archives, and whether it is encrypted or not.</li>
                                <li>If Pampered Pets would go ahead with its digitalisation plans, both GDPR and PCISS would apply to the business. To ensure that those standards are met, it would be recommended to inform customers whenever data collection occurs and give said customers the right to refuse such data collection or to delete their data. Regarding PCISS, it would likely be the easiest option for the business to transfer the responsibility to a third-party payment service, which adhere to PCISS.</li>
                                <li>In my answers, I have assumed that Pampered Pets will go ahead with its digitalisation, which would include an e-commerce platform that offers online payment options. I have also assumed that Pampered Pets collects data bout its customers, for whose secure storage it would be responsible.</li>
