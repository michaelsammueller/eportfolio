							<h1>Unit 3: Reflection</h1>
							<p>I've been working hard on my assignment now for the past few weeks. I understand that risk assessments and reports need to be short and concise, but do find myself struggling with fitting all the details and facts about the business, as well as the all the justifications for the approaches I've used, into the 600-word report.</p>
                            <p>Honestly, I feel like the main challenge of this assignemnt is to figure out how to do exactly that, but it is difficult to decide what to remove and what to include. I don't want the report to over-rely on diagrams, but I do feel like they are necessary to support my arguments. On the other hand, if I reduce the risk analysis itself, then it might seem like I haven't put enough thought into the risks associated with the business. It is really difficult.</p>
                            <p>My plan for now is to include everything I want to include, and then later trimm it down to adhere to the word count. Let's see how that goes.</p>
