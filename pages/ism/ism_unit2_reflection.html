							<h1>Unit 2: Reflection</h1>
							<p>Unit 2 has been very interesting, as it introduced the concept of threat modelling. I have, however, discovered that management or work which is heavily opinionated, is not my cup of tea as of yet, so to say. I am more of a practical person - I prefer programming and hard facts over opinion. As for now, it appears as if for every risk assessment framework/methodology, there are those who support it, and those who oppose it. There are arguments for both sides, but in some instances, while one side completely champions the framework, the other side discounts it as baseless conjecture - something I find difficult to work with.</p>
                            <p>Usually, in programming or mathematics, you have a problem that you need to find a solution for. Yes, there will be several ways to solve a problem, and varying opinions as to which solution is the best, but it's hard to argue with 1s and 0s. It either solves your problem, or it doesn't. If it solves your problem, then no one can discount your solution with an argument of "this doesn't work".</p>
